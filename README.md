# 🛒 Northwind MySQL Project

This project involves creating and analyzing the classic **Northwind database** using **MySQL**. The Northwind dataset represents a fictional trading company that imports and exports specialty foods worldwide. It includes details about customers, employees, orders, products, suppliers, and more—making it ideal for practicing relational database design and SQL queries.

## 📌 1. Project Overview

This repository demonstrates how to:
- Rebuild the **Northwind schema** using SQL DDL (Data Definition Language).
- Populate tables with sample business data.
- Query the dataset to extract insights on customer behavior, product performance, and supply chain activity.

---

## 🎯 2. Project Objectives

- Build a relational database using structured SQL commands.
- ER diagrams
- Explore multi-table relationships using **JOINs**, **aggregations**, and **filters**.
- Generate business insights through analytical SQL queries.
- Simulate real-world database interactions in a retail context.
